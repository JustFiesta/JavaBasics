### How do I understand brute force?
Generate all posabilities including every single subset (set theory). So for generating number with 3 nums we will have at start: *nothing*, 1, 12, 123, etc. (not quite in this order but it's an idea)

### How do I understand generate and test method?
It's improved brute force. It generates only permutations of (in our example) 3 nums. So we will have: 123, 132, 213, 231, etc.
