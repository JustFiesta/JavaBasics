### How do I understand greedy algorithms (algorytmy zach≈Çanne)?
Purpose of this algorithm is to take as many (values) by extracting elementary problems - so similarly to divide and conquer.

They are not the most optimal - but like brute force - just work

##### Coin problem is best example in my opinion.
Just remember about setting good nominals (so one zloty is 100, etc)
