### How do I understand dynamic approach?
Well, it is a divide and conquer WITH remembering of states. But it requires elementary cases already in array. So baisicly you can take math formula like some function with intervals and make elementary cases.  

Then instead of **recursion** you **iterate** and fetch previous elements from array - so it does not calculate same things again. 

Like so in fibbonaci.
